# Project 4: Create Your Own Repository and EDA Project from Scratch

This is the important part. 
Create a new project using Jupyter notebooks from scratch (without starting with existing code.)
Follow the steps below. 

---

## Step 1: Start Project, Open in VS Code

Start a project as usual. 
1. Create a repo in GitHub with a default README.md. Name the repo **datafun-04-eda**. 
2. Clone your new repo down to the Projects folder on your machine. 
3. Open your new project repository folder in VS Code.

---

## Step 2: Add/Update Critical Files

With your new project repo folder open in VS Code, add/update critical project files at the start of every project. 

### Add/Add .gitignore

- The .gitignore file tells Git files to ignore when committing changes.
- Review/copy the example [.gitignore](https://github.com/denisecase/datafun-04-notebooks/blob/main/.gitignore) file, you can use it without modification.

### Add/Update requirements.txt

- The requirements.txt file lists the packages used in the project.
- Review/copy the example [requirements.txt](https://github.com/denisecase/datafun-04-notebooks/blob/main/requirements.txt) file, you can use it without modification.
- You may not use all the listed packages - and may want to add others. Modify the requirements.txt as needed.

### Update README.md

- Edit and customize your README.md to provide an overview of the project and instructions for running it.
 
### Git add-commit-push

After adding .gitignore (or any other key file), run git add, commit, and push to commit your changes to GitHub. 

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 3: Set up Virtual Environment

Next, create and activate a virtual environment for this project. 
Also install additional dependencies required for this project.
See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for detailed instructions. 

A. Create .venv
B. Activate .venv
C. Install dependencies into .venv
D. Select VS Code interpreter to use .venv

---

## Step 4: Create a Jupyter Notebook and Create/Set Kernel

### Create a new notebook

In VS Code, from the menu, select View / Command Palette.

Type `notebook` and select `Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook`.
This will create a new notebook in the project folder.

Save the notebook with a name like `yourname-eda.ipynb`.
The file extension must be exact.

### Create a kernel from .venv

In the active virtual environment, create a Python kernel to run our notebooks. 
The following command registers the .venv virtual environment as a kernel, making it accessible in Jupyter.
Choose the correct command for your operating system.

```shell
py -m ipykernel install --user --name .venv --display-name "Python (.venv)"
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name .venv --display-name "Python (.venv)"
```

Verify the .venv entry appears:

```shell
jupyter kernelspec list
```

### Select the virtual environment for the notebook kernel

In VS Code, select your notebook. 
Then, from the menu, select View > Command Palette.
Type Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel.
Choose the kernel with our local "Python (.venv)" from the list.

This ensures your notebook uses the packages installed in your virtual environment.

## Step 5: Create Your Notebook Incrementally
1. Start building your notebook. 
2. Follow the instructions in [docs/EDA.md](docs/EDA.md).
3. As you work, ensure the notebook continues to run without errors. 
4. Always run "Run All" before committing. 
5. As you make productive changes, use git add-commit-push to save your progress.
